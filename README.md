## ðŸš€ Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies

- HTML and CSS
- Git and GitHub
- Figma

## Project

Project-01 was meant to introduce basic HTML and CSS concepts. In this project I had the opportunity to improve my knowledge about:

- export Figma images and structure the project;
- elements 'div', 'img', 'h1', 'a' and 'p';
- properties src, href and id;
- element position, respecting the HTML order (block and inline);
- elements &lsaquo;span&rsaquo; and &lsaquo;strong&rsaquo;;
