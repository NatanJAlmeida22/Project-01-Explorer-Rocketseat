## ðŸš€ Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies

- HTML and CSS
- Git and GitHub

## Project

Project-01 was meant to introduce basic HTML and CSS concepts. In this project I had the opportunity to improve my knowledge about:

- export Figma images and structure the project;
- elements &lsaquo;div&rsaquo;, &lsaquo;img&rsaquo;, &lsaquo;h1&rsaquo;, &lsaquo;a&rsaquo; and &lsaquo;p&rsaquo;;
- properties src, href and id;
- element position, respecting the HTML order (block and inline);
- elements &lsaquo;span&rsaquo; and &lsaquo;strong&rsaquo;;
- custom fonts and design stylization;
- applying colors to the project texts according to the Figma layout;
- a few CSS properties;
- organization of CSS code and alignment of text and page elements using CSS properties "text-aling";
- adjusting design text and line breaks as a way to use spaces;
- CSS properties "margin" (was applied the "shorthand") in a code snippet and was adjusted the project spacings;
- add a line to the page with the CSS property "border";
- positioning of elements on the page using CSS property "position".
